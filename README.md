# Self Driving Car Nanodegree - Capstone Project : System Integration

## Team :
* Jun Zhang, team lead
* Andr√© Bonatto 
* April O`Neil
* Fabian Hertwig

## Project objectives
The objective of this project is to implement ROS-based core of an autonomous vehicle. The vehicle shall be able to complete a closed-circuit test-track, detecting the traffic lights and stopping whenever required. The code will be evaluated in a Unity simulator and a real-world Lincoln MKZ. More details on the project can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/6047fe34-d93c-4f50-8336-b70ef10cb4b2/modules/e1a23b06-329a-4684-a717-ad476f0d8dff/lessons/462c933d-9f24-42d3-8bdc-a08a5fc866e4/concepts/5ab4b122-83e6-436d-850f-9f4d26627fd9).

### Specifications
The car should :
* Smoothly follow waypoints in the simulator.
* Respect the target top speed set for the waypoints' twist.twist.linear.x in waypoint_loader.py. 
* Stop at traffic lights when needed.
* Stop and restart PID controllers depending on the state of /vehicle/dbw_enabled.
* Publish throttle, steering, and brake commands at 50hz.

## ROS Architecture
The autonomous driving system is composed of perception, planning and control. The modules communicate according to the following ROS structure of nodes and topics :

## Build Instructions 

Please use **one** of the two installation options, either native **or** docker installation.

### Native Installation

* Be sure that your workstation is running Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial Xerus or Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahir. [Ubuntu downloads can be found here](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop).
* If using a Virtual Machine to install Ubuntu, use the following configuration as minimum:
  * 2 CPU
  * 2 GB system memory
  * 25 GB of free hard drive space

  The Udacity provided virtual machine has ROS and Dataspeed DBW already installed, so you can skip the next two steps if you are using this.

* Follow these instructions to install ROS
  * [ROS Kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu) if you have Ubuntu 16.04.
  * [ROS Indigo](http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu) if you have Ubuntu 14.04.
* [Dataspeed DBW](https://bitbucket.org/DataspeedInc/dbw_mkz_ros)
  * Use this option to install the SDK on a workstation that already has ROS installed: [One Line SDK Install (binary)](https://bitbucket.org/DataspeedInc/dbw_mkz_ros/src/81e63fcc335d7b64139d7482017d6a97b405e250/ROS_SETUP.md?fileviewer=file-view-default)
* Download the [Udacity Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Capstone/releases).

### Docker Installation
[Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

Build the docker container
```bash
docker build . -t capstone
```

Run the docker file
```bash
docker run -p 4567:4567 -v $PWD:/capstone -v /tmp/log:/root/.ros/ --rm -it capstone
```

### Port Forwarding
To set up port forwarding, please refer to the [instructions from term 2](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/16cf4a78-4fc7-49e1-8621-3450ca938b77)

### Usage

1. Clone the project repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Capstone.git
```

2. Install python dependencies
```bash
cd CarND-Capstone
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Make and run styx
```bash
cd ros
catkin_make
source devel/setup.sh
roslaunch launch/styx.launch
```
4. Run the simulator

## Testing the implementation

### Drive-by-wire testing
1. Download the [dbw bag](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/files/reference.bag.zip)
2. Unzip the file to CarND-Capstone/ros and rename it to dbw_test.rosbag.bag
3. source ros/devel/setup.sh
4. roslaunch ros/src/twist_controller/launch/dbw_test.launch

This will produce the files brakes.csv, steers.csv and throttles.csv, comparing the reference command with the current implementation.

### Traffic light detection with real world images
1. Download [training bag](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/traffic_light_bag_file.zip) that was recorded on the Udacity self-driving car.
2. Unzip the file
```bash
unzip traffic_light_bag_file.zip
```
3. Play the bag file
```bash
rosbag play -l traffic_light_bag_file/traffic_light_training.bag
```
4. Launch your project in site mode
```bash
cd CarND-Capstone/ros
roslaunch launch/site.launch
```
5. Confirm that traffic light detection works on real life images
